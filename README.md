# machine_learning
There are my steps of studying machine learning. The repository consists of a set of courses that cover topics such as:
- linear regression
- classification
- clustering (k-means, DBSCAN, hierarchical clustering)
- gradient boosting
- SVM
- KNN
- decision trees
- random forests
- boosted trees
- time series analysis
